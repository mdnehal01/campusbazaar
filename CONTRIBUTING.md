## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow React best practices

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  college: string;
}

const getUserProfile = async (userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> => {
  // Implementation
};

// ‚ùå Bad
const getStuff = async (id: any) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### React Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use proper prop typing
- Follow naming conventions

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ProductCardProps {
  product: Product;
  onAddToCart: (productId: string) => void;
}

const ProductCard: React.FC<ProductCardProps> = ({ product, onAddToCart }) => {
  return (
    <div className="product-card">
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductCard;
```

### CSS/Tailwind Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use semantic class names for custom CSS
- Keep components responsive

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/3">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat: add user authentication with Supabase
fix: resolve cart total calculation error
docs: update API documentation for product endpoints
style: format code according to prettier rules
refactor: extract cart logic into custom hook
perf: optimize image loading with lazy loading
test: add unit tests for product validation
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

## Code Comments Convention

We use a specific commenting system:

- `TODO:` - Features that need to be implemented
- `KNOW:` - Code explanations and documentation  
- `DONE:` - Completed functionality (previously TODO)

```typescript
// TODO: Implement advanced search filters
// KNOW: This function calculates sustainability score based on product lifecycle
// DONE: Added user authentication and session management
```

## Project Structure Guidelines

When adding new files, follow our established structure:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                    # Next.js App Router pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/             # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                # Base UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature]/         # Feature-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/               # Server actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                   # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/             # Context providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                  # Static data and constants
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for complex components
- Test error scenarios
- Maintain good test coverage

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('ProductCard Component', () => {
  it('should render product information correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle add to cart action', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should display error state when product is unavailable', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Documentation Guidelines

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document API endpoints
- Include examples in documentation

## Getting Help
